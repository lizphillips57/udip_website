16:11:57	 From Pierre Thibodeaux (he/him) : i muted everyone! later, during the panel we will allow people to ask questions, including video/audio questions but aside from that i will be judiciously muting people
16:11:58	 From Pierre Thibodeaux (he/him) : haha
16:19:33	 From Pierre Thibodeaux (he/him) : How dod you acclimate to the different academic and social climate of college?
16:22:13	 From Pierre Thibodeaux (he/him) : Hey everyone if you have any questions please either put them in the chat or dm them to me! I will then ask them to the panelists. OR raise your hands and I will let you ask yourself
16:23:11	 From Liz Phillips(any pronouns) : How often does UDIP have meetings and what do you usually discuss during them? What kind of events do you plan?
16:27:15	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : Join the discord: https://discord.gg/PzPbSUm
16:28:59	 From Jianjie Xu : How many units did you take in the first quarter?
16:29:31	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : I believe I took 16 units, which is somewhat normal for a semester unit but not a quarter system
16:30:11	 From Sam Kresch (He, Him) : Is it possible to make connections with professors even with online and asynchronous classes?
16:30:59	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : Usually professors will have office hours zoom links, just join them and start talking :)
16:31:31	 From Sofia Hillman (she/her) : '
16:33:50	 From Liz Phillips(any pronouns) : when asking questions during the lecture, would we just ask them in the zoom chat or raise our hand or something? I don't want to interrupt them obviously
16:34:06	 From Pierre Thibodeaux (he/him) : either is fine!
16:34:20	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : some professors have a system so make sure to ask them on the first day!
16:34:28	 From Mindy Harkness (she/her) : Often times professors will tell you on the first day what is the best method
16:34:33	 From Mindy Harkness (she/her) : Oh rt what Kenneth said then
16:34:46	 From Yiluo Li : (Presenting problems to friends would also help with understanding)
16:40:43	 From Jianjie Xu : Hi Mindy, can talk more about your understanding of and experience with medical physics? Thanks!
16:41:10	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : I would also like to hear this too LOL 
16:43:37	 From Sam Kresch (He, Him) : Should we always go to office hours or only when we need help?
16:44:26	 From Yiluo Li : I feel like “keep exploring” should be an advice for undergrad from freshman to senior. Some subfields require a bit more knowledge to appreciate, and perhaps you will have a different perspective once you become a senior.
16:44:48	 From Kenneth Lara(He, Him, His) : @sam I would say somewhere in the middle, if there are other people in office hours that do have question do not bug the professor with non course material 
16:52:51	 From Yiluo Li (she/her) : Utilize Discord! Haha
