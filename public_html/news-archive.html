			      Are you curious about applying your skills in a research setting? Looking to branch out of academia and venture into industry? Are you wondering what you're going to do after getting your degree? We're happy to help guide you through these big decisions! Beginning this Fall Quarter, we'll be hosting a seminar series on general application strategies for fellowships, research opportunities, grad school, and industry. We'll be discussing
			      <ol>
			        <li> How to build a strong application </li>
			        <li> How to write a compelling personal statement </li>
			        <li> How to build a CV and Resumé </li>
			        <li> How to apply for summer research opportunities or internships </li>
			        <li> How to choose a graduate program or job in industry </li>
			        <li> How to transition from academia to industry </li>
			      </ol>
			      We also plan to host two panels: one with professors from admission committees and the other with graduated students. In addition, several of our sessions will be dedicated to helping students one on one with application materials! This will be useful to seniors who are preparing applications, and students earlier in their career by learning what makes a strong application.
			      If you are interested in attending these sessions, please take a moment to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKXUwI-fbr9CDhtfbSCmc1zmQ5bRwHWNBFMgzov8vtX6TBVg/viewform">this survey</a>. We are very interested to hear of specific topics you'd like to discuss!
